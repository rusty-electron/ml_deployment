# AISA Study Project ML Deployment Options

## Abstract

In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of deployment options for ML components. As an initial step, we identified existing deployment options, such as AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, BentoML, etc. We also created a list of criteria for comparison, such as their supported input frameworks, model explainability and monitoring during deployment. Furthermore, we compared the options side by side by reviewing their documentation and put together the list of data sources. Our comparative analysis is presented in a table and the data sources are available in our GitLab repository. Finally, some comparison criteria addressing practical metrics such as deployment time and ease of use will require hands-on tests, this can be the topic of future research. Our study assists practitioners in making decisions regarding the choice of deployment option based on their needs.

## Introduction

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in deploying “smart systems”, which are able to emulate human behavior on specific tasks [a]. Typically, these systems employ machine learning(ML) techniques to achieve their human-like behavior. When deploying the system, we must also deploy the ML model as a part of it. While implementing a bespoke solution is always an option, recent years have seen a rise in the number of off-the-shelf deployment options [b], e.g., TensorFlow Serving or MLflow (see [list](#deployment-options)). This growing competition could overwhelm an ML practitioner who is looking for a solution to deploy their ML models, for example, in the context of a make-or-buy decision. A comparative analysis of off-the-shelf deployment options across well-reasoned criteria would help them gain clarity about their needs and identify suitable options that fulfill these needs.

## Method

As the basis for the comparison, a very lightweight, non-systematic literature survey approach [c–e] was adopted that helped to identify criteria and off-the-shelf deployment options. This literature survey included grey literature since many deployment options have not been part of the academic discussion before. Grey literature also identified prior work on comparing deployment options, which served as the foundation for the rest of the study. Based on the literature survey, a catalog of criteria was synthesized. The catalog was then employed to analyze the documentation of each deployment option and synthesize comparison of the identified options [f,g]. The catalog of criteria and the results of the comparison were documented in a scientific report and presented as a poster.

### Analysis

As platform-exclusive, such as TensorFlow Serving, which specializes in deployment services for TensorFlow models, and Torch Serve, which only supports pytorch models, their documentation does not mention that they have monitoring and explanation, anomaly detection.

Meanwhile, compared to platforms with their own large machine learning ecosystems such as AWS SageMaker belonging to Amazon and Azure ML belonging to Microsoft, and Vertex AI belonging to Google, some open source deployment platforms such as BentoML, Kubeflow,Mlflow, RayServe are generally compatible with most of the ML model types.

Some open source deployment platforms such as BentoML, Kubeflow, Mlflow, RayServe are generally compatible with most of the ML model input types, but have limited functionality such as model monitoring and anomaly detection and model explanation and offline batch processing. However, they tend to collaborate with other open source platforms such as Captum, grafana and Alibi detect, which is a huge advantage for them as an open source platform.

From a business point of view, there is no doubt that reliable and well-established features and ecosystems are the strengths of AWS SageMaker, Vertex AI, and Azure ML, and at the same time, this corresponds to the corresponding expenses, and they have different payment rates, which basically depends on the user's purpose and scale of use. Additionally although most of the open source platforms have an open source While most of the open source platforms have an open source, free nature, Seldon Core has a Business Source License 1.1 that restricts the use of some of them. Finally, the most popular of the open source projects is RayServe, which we believe is related to its "scalable model serving library for building online inference APIs". As an existing issue, it has been documented that MLflow does not have the capability for offline batch processing, and that developing this capability could be a future research direction.

## Future Work

* Conducting hands-on experiments and deployment tests for each machine learning deployment framework to assess more criteria. More specifically, **Deployment Time Analysis**, **Cost Evaluation**, **Cross-Platform Compatibility and Interoperability**, **Scalability and Performance Testing, User Experience** and **Ease of Use** should be considered.
* **Extend the comparative analysis** to include ML frameworks for other stages of the MLops process, such as data preparation, model design and model training.
* **Refine the analysis** for domain specific use cases, compare and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of these framework in task specific models i.e., computer vision models, LLMs, LSTMs, etc. This is because different frameworks are optimized for different tasks.
* **Market analysis** by comparing their popularity and pricing plan in different aspects such as user-group, security, low-latency use case, etc.
* **Development** of Offline Batch processing for MLflow.
